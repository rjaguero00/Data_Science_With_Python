ORDER BY QUIZ

1. SELECT id, occurred_at, total_amt_usd
FROM orders
ORDER BY occurred_at
LIMIT 10;

2. SELECT id, account_id, total_amt_usd
FROM orders
ORDER BY total_amt_usd DESC
LIMIT 5;

3. SELECT id, account_id, total_amt_usd
FROM orders
ORDER BY total_amt_usd
LIMIT 20;

ORDER BY QUIZ II

1. Write a query that displays the order ID, account ID, and total dollar amount for all the orders, sorted first by the account ID (in ascending order), and then by the total dollar amount (in descending order).
SELECT id, account_id, total_amt_usd
FROM orders
ORDER BY account_id, total_amt_usd DESC;

2. Now write a query that again displays order ID, account ID, and total dollar amount for each order, but this time sorted first by total dollar amount (in descending order), and then by account ID (in ascending order).
SELECT id, account_id, total_amt_usd
FROM orders
ORDER BY total_amt_usd DESC, account_id;

WHERE QUIZ
1.Pulls the first 5 rows and all columns from the orders table that have a dollar amount of gloss_amt_usd greater than or equal to 1000.
SELECT * 
FROM orders
WHERE gloss_amt_usd >= 100
LIMIT 5;

2.Pulls the first 10 rows and all columns from the orders table that have a total_amt_usd less than 500.
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE total_amt_usd <= 500
LIMIT 10;

WHERE with non-numeric values practice
1.SELECT name, website, primary_poc
FROM accounts
WHERE name = 'Exxon Mobil';

Arithmetic Operators
1. Create a column that divides the standard_amt_usd by the standard_qty to find the unit price for standard paper for each order. Limit the results to the first 10 orders, and include the id and account_id fields.
SELECT id,
account_id,
standard_amt_usd / standard_qty AS standard_paper_price
FROM orders
LIMIT 10;

2. 
(EASY WAY)
SELECT id,
account_id,
(poster_amt_usd / total_amt_usd) * 100
FROM orders;

(WITHOUT OUT USING total_amt_usd)
SELECT id,
account_id,
poster_amt_usd / (standard_amt_usd + gloss_amt_usd + poster_amt_usd) * 100 AS poster_percent_rev
FROM orders
LIMIT 10;

LIKE Operator
1.All the companies whose names start with 'C'.
SELECT name
FROM accounts
WHERE name LIKE 'C%';

2.All companies whose names contain the string 'one' somewhere in the name.
SELECT name
FROM accounts
WHERE name LIKE '%one%';

3.All companies whose names end with 's'.
SELECT name
FROM accounts
WHERE name LIKE '%s'
