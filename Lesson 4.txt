Question 1.

Table 1 - finds the total_amt_usd assiociated with each sales rep and their region.

SELECT s.name rep_name, r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt
FROM sales_reps s, accounts a, orders o, region r
WHERE s.region_id = r.id AND s.id = a.sales_rep_id AND a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 3 DESC;

Table 2 - Now we want the top total_amt_usd for each region.

SELECT region_name,  MAX(total_amt) total_amt
FROM(SELECT s.name rep_name, r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt
FROM sales_reps s, accounts a, orders o, region r
WHERE s.region_id = r.id AND s.id = a.sales_rep_id AND a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY 1,2) t1
GROUP BY 1;


Table 3 - Lastly, find the sales reps name of the top total_amt_usd for each region. 

SELECT t3.rep_name, t3.region_name, t3.total_amt
FROM(SELECT region_name, MAX(total_amt) total_amt
     FROM(SELECT s.name rep_name, r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt
            FROM sales_reps s, accounts a, orders o, region r
          	WHERE s.region_id = r.id AND s.id = a.sales_rep_id AND a.id = o.account_id
             GROUP BY 1, 2) t1
     GROUP BY 1) t2
JOIN (SELECT s.name rep_name, r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt
   FROM sales_reps s, accounts a, orders o, region r
          	WHERE s.region_id = r.id AND s.id = a.sales_rep_id AND a.id = o.account_id
     GROUP BY 1,2
     ORDER BY 3 DESC) t3
ON t3.region_name = t2.region_name AND t3.total_amt = t2.total_amt;


Question 2

Table 1 - Find the region and the total sum of total_amt

SELECT r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt
FROM sales_reps s, accounts a, orders o, region r
WHERE s.region_id = r.id AND s.id = a.sales_rep_id AND a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

NEXT - Pull the largest total

SELECT MAX(total_amt)
FROM (SELECT r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt
    WHERE s.region_id = r.id AND s.id = a.sales_rep_id AND a.id = o.account_id
    GROUP BY r.name) t1;

LAST - Now pull the total orders from this region with the largest amount

SELECT r.name, COUNT(o.total) total_orders
FROM sales_reps s, accounts a, orders o, region r
WHERE s.region_id = r.id AND s.id = a.sales_rep_id AND a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY r.name
HAVING SUM(o.total_amt_usd) = (
SELECT MAX(total_amt)
FROM (SELECT r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt
FROM sales_reps s, accounts a, orders o, region r
WHERE s.region_id = r.id AND s.id = a.sales_rep_id AND a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY r.name) t1);


QUESTION 3

- Pull account name with total standard_qty ordered and total of all orders(standard, gloss, and poster qty)

SELECT a.name account_name, SUM(o.standard_qty) total_std, SUM(o.total) total
FROM accounts a, orders o
WHERE a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 1;

-Pulls the accounts with total > standard_qty

SELECT a.name
FROM accounts a, orders o
WHERE a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY 1 
HAVING SUM(o.total) > (SELECT a.name account_name, SUM(o.standard_qty) total_std, SUM(o.total) total
FROM accounts a, orders o
WHERE a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 1) t1);

-Gives us the count of accounts the met the condidtion total > standard_qty

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM (SELECT a.name
FROM accounts a, orders o
WHERE a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY 1 
HAVING SUM(o.total) > (SELECT total
FROM (SELECT a.name account_name, SUM(o.standard_qty) total_std, SUM(o.total) total
FROM accounts a, orders o
WHERE a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 1) t1)
      ) t2;

QUESTION 4

- Pulls cumstomer that spent the most over a lifetime
SELECT a.id acc_id, a.name account_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_spent
FROM accounts a, orders o
WHERE a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 3 DESC
LIMIT 1;

- By match the id found in the table above we can now find the number of events this company had on each channel.

SELECT a.name, w.channel, COUNT(*)
FROM accounts a, web_events w
WHERE a.id = w.account_id AND a.id = (SELECT id
FROM (SELECT a.id, a.name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) tot_spent
      FROM orders o, accounts a
      WHERE a.id = o.account_id
      GROUP BY a.id, a.name
      ORDER BY 3 DESC
      LIMIT 1) t1)
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 3 DESC;

QUESTION 5

- Pull the top 10 spending accounts

SELECT a.id, a.name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) tot_spent
FROM accounts a, orders o
WHERE a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 3 DESC
LIMIT 10;

- Now we just need to find the average spending amount of these 10 accounts

SELECT AVG (tot_spent)
FROM (SELECT a.id, a.name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) tot_spent
FROM accounts a, orders o
WHERE a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 3 DESC
LIMIT 10) t1;

QUESTION 6

-Pull the average of all accounts == total_amt_usd

SELECT AVG(o.total_amt_usd) avg_all
FROM orders o;

-This then pulls all accounts that are > than the avg_all

SELECT o.account_id, AVG(o.total_amt_usd)
FROM orders o
GROUP BY 1
HAVING AVG(o.total_amt_usd) > (SELECT AVG(o.total_amt_usd) avg_all
FROM orders o);

-Than we average all the accounts we found above that were > than the avg_all

SELECT AVG(avg_amt)
FROM (SELECT o.account_id, AVG(o.total_amt_usd) avg_amt
    FROM orders o
    GROUP BY 1
    HAVING AVG(o.total_amt_usd) > (SELECT AVG(o.total_amt_usd) avg_all
                                   FROM orders o)) t1;
