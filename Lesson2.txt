JOIN QUIZ
1. Provide a table for all web_events associated with account name of Walmart. There should be three columns. Be sure to include the primary_poc, time of the event, and the channel for each event. Additionally, you might choose to add a fourth column to assure only Walmart events were chosen.

SELECT web_events.occurred_at, web_events.channel, accounts.primary_poc, accounts.name
FROM web_events
JOIN accounts
ON web_events.account_id = accounts.id
WHERE name IN ('Walmart');

2.Provide a table that provides the region for each sales_rep along with their associated accounts. Your final table should include three columns: the region name, the sales rep name, and the account name. Sort the accounts alphabetically (A-Z) according to account name.

SELECT region.name region_name, sales_reps.name sales_reps_name, accounts.name account_name
FROM sales_reps
JOIN region
ON region.id = sales_reps.region_id
JOIN accounts
ON accounts.sales_rep_id = sales_reps.id
ORDER BY account_name ASC;

3.Provide the name for each region for every order, as well as the account name and the unit price they paid (total_amt_usd/total) for the order. Your final table should have 3 columns: region name, account name, and unit price. A few accounts have 0 for total, so I divided by (total + 0.01) to assure not dividing by zero.

SELECT region.name region_name, accounts.name account_name, orders.total_amt_usd/(orders.total + 0.01) unit_price
FROM region
JOIN sales_reps
ON sales_reps.region_id = region.id
JOIN accounts
