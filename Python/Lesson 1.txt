Data Types and Operators

1.  Find an average for $23, $32, and $64
print((23 + 32 + 64) / 3)

2.Two parts of a floor need tiling. One part is 9 tiles wide by 7 tiles long, the other is 5 tiles wide by 7 tiles long. Tiles come in packages of 6.
-How many tiles are needed?
print(9 * 7 + 5 * 7)

-
You buy 17 packages of tiles containing 6 tiles each. How many tiles will be left over?
print((17 * 6) - (9 * 7 + 5 * 7))


Quiz 2

# The current volume of a water reservoir (in cubic metres)
reservoir_volume = 4.445e8
# The amount of rainfall from a storm (in cubic metres)
rainfall = 5e6

# decrease the rainfall variable by 10% to account for runoff  
rainfalL *= (1-.10)
print(rainfall)

# add the rainfall variable to the reservoir_volume variable
reservoir_volume += rainfall


# increase reservoir_volume by 5% to account for stormwater that flows
# into the reservoir in the days following the storm

reservoir_volume *= (1+.05)


# decrease reservoir_volume by 5% to account for evaporation
reservoir_volume *=(1-.05)


# subtract 2.5e5 cubic metres from reservoir_volume to account for water
# that's piped to arid regions.
reservoir_volume -=2.5e5

# print the new value of the reservoir_volume variable
print(reservoir_volume)
