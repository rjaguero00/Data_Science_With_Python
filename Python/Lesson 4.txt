# '''
# You decide you want to play a game where you are hiding 
# a number from someone.  Store this number in a variable 
# called 'answer'.  Another user provides a number called
# 'guess'.  By comparing guess to answer, you inform the user
# if their guess is too high or too low.

# Fill in the conditionals below to inform the user about how
# their guess compares to the answer.
# '''

elif guess > answer:
    result = "Oops!  Your guess was too high."
elif guess == answer:
    result = "Nice!  Your guess matched the answer!"

Quiz 3 
1. Create a new list named username and lowercase each name and replace the space with underscores


names = ["Joey Tribbiani", "Monica Geller", "Chandler Bing", "Phoebe Buffay"]
usernames = []

# write your for loop here
for name in names:
    usernames.append(name.lower().replace(" ", "_"))


print(usernames)



2. Same thing as above but now use range to lowercase usernames and replace space with underscores

usernames = ["Joey Tribbiani", "Monica Geller", "Chandler Bing", "Phoebe Buffay"]

# write your for loop here
for index in range (len(usernames)):
    usernames[index] = usernames[index].lower().replace(" ", "_")

print(usernames)


3. Write a for loop that iterates over a list of strings, tokens, and counts how many of them are XML tags.

tokens = ['<greeting>', 'Hello World!', '</greeting>']
count = 0

# write your for loop here
for token in tokens:
    if token.startswith("<") and token.endswith(">"):
            count += 1

print(count)


4. Write some code, including a for loop, that iterates over a list of strings and creates a single string, html_str, which is an HTML list. 


items = ['first string', 'second string']
html_str = "<ul>\n"


# write your code here
for item in items:
    html_str += "<li>{}</li>\n".format(item)
html_str += "</ul>"


print(html_str)

1.
# You would like to count the number of fruits in your basket.

#if the key is in the list of fruits, add the value (number of fruits) to result
for object, count in basket_items.items():
   if object in fruits:

print("There are {} fruits in the basket". format(result))


2.
# You would like to count the number of fruits in your basket. 
# In order to do this, you have the following dictionary and list of
# fruits.  Use the dictionary and list to count the total number
# of fruits and not_fruits.

basket_items = {'apples': 4, 'oranges': 19, 'kites': 3, 'sandwiches': 8}

#Iterate through the dictionary

#if the key is in the list of fruits, add to fruit_count.

   if object in fruits:
       fruit_count += count
else:
    not_fruit_count += count
